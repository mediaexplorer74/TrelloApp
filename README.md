## Getting your "Trello keys"

Please read this (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/) :
"The Trello API is extremely powerful and fun to use. 
Building a full application with Trello for web or mobile means getting to know the various concepts and models making up Trello.

We're going to walk you through getting your API key and token, making a few requests, 
and then give a high-level look at some of the most popular API resources..."

Then use your PC to login to Trello (https://trello.com) and generate your magic keys (https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate)
